                    <h2>Alan Patrige</h2>
                    <img src="../images/partridge.jpg" alt="Alan Patridge scene">
                    <p>Easily his most iconic (and most hilarious) character, Steve Coogan’s Alan Partridge exists
                        across film and television. He’s a miserable journalist who’s terrible at his job, but it leads
                        to plenty of incredible goofs and memorable gags that make it all worth watching. The character
                        has been around for nearly 30 years now, but there’s no end in sight for him (and no sign of him
                        getting any better at his job, either).</p>

                    <h2>24 Hour Party People</h2>
                    <img src="../images/24-hour.jpg" alt="24 Hour Party People scene">
                    <p>A true story about the origin of Factory Records and its impact on Manchester, UK’s music
                        industry, Steve Coogan stars in 24 Hour Party People as real-life record mogul Tony Wilson. Over
                        15 years since its release and 40 since the events unfolded, the movie remains one of the
                        greatest (and funniest) movies about the music industry ever made. It’s proof that, while Coogan
                        might be a comedian first and foremost, he’s also a great actor.</p>

                <div id="the-trip">
                    <h2>The Trip Trilogy</h2>
                    <img src="../images/the-trip.jpg" alt="The Trip scene">
                    <p>Impossible to pinpoint which one is the greatest, Coogan and fellow comedian Rob Brydon star in a
                        trilogy of films (that originated as a television series) called The Trip. Each around a couple
                        hours each, the three films basically consist of two passive-aggressive friends spending time in
                        beautiful places, eating good food, and picking on each other. They’re simple and accessible,
                        but they’re so incredibly funny.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="philomena">
                    <h2>Philomena</h2>
                    <img src="../images/philomena.jpg" alt="Philomena scene">
                    <p>
                        Coogan’s most well-known dramatic role, Philomena sees the comedian playing a much better
                        journalist than Alan Partridge. The movie is based on a true story, telling the tale of a woman
                        on the search for her long lost child and the journalist who helps her along the way. He helped
                        write the screenplay, which resulted in his first two Oscar nominations ever.

                    <h2>What Maisies Knew</h2>
                    <img src="../images/what-maisie-knew.jpg" alt="What Maisie Knew scene">
                    <p>A sharp and troubling film about a bitter custody battle, What Maisie Knew follows Coogan
                        alongside Julianne Moore as two parents who recklessly remarry in an attempt to get a leg up on
                        one another during court proceedings (leaving their seven-year-old daughter caught between the
                        two of them). Coogan is doing a one-of-a-kind job here, taking risks with his character and
                        proving himself to be plenty talented.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="coffee-and-cigarettes">
                    <h2>Coffee and Cigarettes</h2>
                    <img src="../images/coffee.jpg" alt="Coffee and Cigarettes scene">
                    <p>Written and directed by Jim Jarmusch, Coffee and Cigarettes tells many stories united by… well,
                        coffee and cigarettes. Starring alongside Bill Murray, Tom Waits, Steve Buscemi, musicals Iggy
                        Pop and RZA, even Cate Blanchett and Alfred Molina, Steve Coogan brings his signature sense of
                        humor to the table and ends up leaving a memorable and lasting impression. It’s a pleasantly
                        human film, just like much of Jarmusch’s other work, and Coogan is a welcome addition.</p>

                <div id="marie-antoinette">
                    <h2>Marie Antoinette</h2>
                    <img src="../images/marie.jpg" alt="Marie Antoinette scene">
                    <p>From writer and director Sofia Coppola comes a reimagining of the famous life of France’s last
                        Queen before their subsequent revolution. Coogan’s playing an ambassador and is put on the back
                        burner in a supporting role, but it doesn’t matter — the film’s extravagance and the director’s
                        soft style result in something really great (and something that Coogan should be proud to be a
                        part of).</p>
                </div>
                <div id="ruby-sparks">
                    <h2>Ruby Sparks</h2>
                    <img src="../images/ruby-sparks.jpg" alt="Ruby Sparks scene">
                    <p>From directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris and writer Zoe Kazan, Ruby Sparks is a quirky
                        little film about a novelist who creates a female character that he ends up falling in love
                        with. Coogan’s an important part of the story, often showing up with some really great lines.
                        The 2010s saw Coogan settling into many independent American films, and Ruby Sparks is one of
                        quite a few examples.</p>

                <div id="stan-and-ollie">
                    <h2>Stan and Ollie</h2>
                    <img src="../images/stan-and-ollie.jpg" alt="Stan and Ollie scene">
                    <p>From the writer of Philomena, Stan and Ollie sees Coogan embodying famous early 20th century
                        comedian Stan Laurel alongside John C. Reilly as Oliver Hardy. The movie has gathered plenty of
                        nominations for the actors’s great performances, so this is undoubtedly a role that Coogan
                        should cherish. The actor really takes on the part with gusto, practically transforming into the
                        comedian himself seamlessly.</p>

                <div id="hot-fuzz">
                    <h2>Hot Fuzz</h2>
                    <img src="../images/hot-fuzz.jpg" alt="Hot Fuzz scene">
                    <p>The second installment of Edgar Wright’s Cornetto Trilogy, Hot Fuzz is a send-up of all the great
                        buddy cop movies of the 20th century. Wright always finds a way to include the best comedians in
                        his films, even if they’re just doing a bit part. This is the case with Hot Fuzz: Coogan plays a
                        Metropolitan Police Inspector, but anyone who’s seen the film knows that the part transcends its
                        minimal screen time.</p>
