                    <p>Easily his most iconic (and most hilarious) character, Steve Coogan’s Alan Partridge exists
                        across film and television. He’s a miserable journalist who’s terrible at his job, but it leads
                        to plenty of incredible goofs and memorable gags that make it all worth watching. The character
                        has been around for nearly 30 years now, but there’s no end in sight for him (and no sign of him
                        getting any better at his job, either).</p>

                    <p>A true story about the origin of Factory Records and its impact on Manchester, UK’s music
                        industry, Steve Coogan stars in 24 Hour Party People as real-life record mogul Tony Wilson. Over
                        15 years since its release and 40 since the events unfolded, the movie remains one of the
                        greatest (and funniest) movies about the music industry ever made. It’s proof that, while Coogan
                        might be a comedian first and foremost, he’s also a great actor.</p>

                    <p>Impossible to pinpoint which one is the greatest, Coogan and fellow comedian Rob Brydon star in a
                        trilogy of films (that originated as a television series) called The Trip. Each around a couple
                        hours each, the three films basically consist of two passive-aggressive friends spending time in
                        beautiful places, eating good food, and picking on each other. They’re simple and accessible,
                        but they’re so incredibly funny.</p>

                        Coogan’s most well-known dramatic role, Philomena sees the comedian playing a much better
                        journalist than Alan Partridge. The movie is based on a true story, telling the tale of a woman
                        on the search for her long lost child and the journalist who helps her along the way. He helped
                        write the screenplay, which resulted in his first two Oscar nominations ever.
